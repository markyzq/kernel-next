Rockchip armv7-timer:
---------------------

The architected timer on rk3288 SoCs has special setup requirements, as
the cpu-timer block needs to supply the architected timer.

Required node properties:
- compatible value : = "rockchip,rk3288-armv7-timer";
- reg : physical base address and the size of the registers window
        of the supplying timer block
- CP15 Timer node properties as described in bindings/arm/arch_timer.txt

Example:

architected-timer {
	compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-armv7-timer";
	reg = <0xff810020 0x20>;
	interrupts = <GIC_PPI 13 (GIC_CPU_MASK_SIMPLE(4) | IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH)>,
		     <GIC_PPI 14 (GIC_CPU_MASK_SIMPLE(4) | IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH)>,
		     <GIC_PPI 11 (GIC_CPU_MASK_SIMPLE(4) | IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH)>;
	clock-frequency = <24000000>;
};
